# DS_Module14
# EX.NO : 2(A) Dequeue Elements from Circular Queue
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to delete three elements from the filled circular queue.

## Algorithm
1. Start 
2. Define a queue with a fixed size SIZE and initialize front and rear pointers. 
3. Define the deQueue() function to remove and return an element from the front of the queue. 
4. Check if the queue is empty using isEmpty(); if empty, print an error message. 
5. If the queue has one element, reset both front and rear to -1. 
6. If the queue has more than one element, update front to the next index using modulo operation ((front + 1) % SIZE). 
7. Return the removed element from the front of the queue. 
8. End

  int element = items[front];
  if(isEmpty())
  {
      printf("Queue is empty");
  }
  else
  {
      if(front==rear) 
      { 
          front=-1; 
          rear=-1; 
      } 
      else
      {
          front = (front+1)%SIZE;
      } 
  }
  return element;
}

# EX.NO : 2(B) Priority Queue
## DATE:
## AIM:
To formulate the C code to display the elements of the priority queue after insertion and deletion operation.

## Algorithm
1. Start 
2. Define a function printArray() that takes an array and its size as parameters. 
3. Loop through the array from index 0 to size-1. 
4. Print each element of the array during the loop. 
5. After printing all elements, print a newline for formatting. 
6. End    

## Program:
```

/*#include <stdio.h>
int size = 0;
*/
void printArray(int array[], int size) {
  int i;
  if(size == 0)
  {
      printf("Heap is empty");
  }
  else
  {
    for(i=0; i<size; i++)
    {
      printf("%d ", array[i]);
    }

# EX.NO : 2(C) Deque
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C function to count the number of elements present in the deque.

## Algorithm
1. Start 
2. Define a function count() that takes an array arr as input. 
3. Initialize a counter c to track the number of non-zero elements. 
4. Loop through the array from index 0 to MAX-1. 
5. For each element, check if it's non-zero. 
6. If the element is non-zero, increment the counter c. 
7. Return the final count of non-zero elements in the array. 
8. End 

## Program:
```
/*

Developed by: LOKESH RAHUL V V
RegisterNumber: 212222100024

```
```c

#define MAX 10

void addRear(int *, int, int *, int *);
int delFront(int *, int *, int *);
int delRear(int *, int *, int *);
void display(int *);
int count(int *);
*/
int count(int *arr) 
{
    int c = 0;
    int i = 0;
  while(arr[i] != -1)
  {
      c++;
      i++;
  }
  return c;
}

# EX.NO : 2(D) Applications of Queue - SJF
## DATE:
## AIM:
To incorporate the code to calculate the Total Waiting Time and Average Waiting Time in Shortest Job First scheduling algorithm.
## Algorithm
1. Start 
2. Read the number of processes n and their burst times into the array bt[]. 
3. Assign process numbers to array p[] (from 1 to n). 
4. Sort the processes based on burst time using selection sort, updating both bt[] and p[] arrays. 
5. Calculate the waiting time wt[] for each process by summing burst times of previous processes. 
6. Calculate the turnaround time tat[] as the sum of burst time and waiting time for each process. 
7. Compute and print the average waiting time and average turnaround time. 
8. End
